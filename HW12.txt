A1:
	the output will be :

	"hey from message1" 

	BECOUSE: there's no another command & we use one @Bean annotation.


A2:
	the output will be :

	"hey from message1"
	"hey from message2"

	BECOUSE: we use @Qualifier before getMessage1() method and we assign this
 	@Qualifier to the perameter in getMessage2() method.

A3:
	the output will be :

	"hey from message3"
	"hey from message1"
	"hey from message2"
	
	OR :

	"hey from message3"
	"hey from message2"
	"hey from message1"

	BECOUSE: we use @Qualifier("3") in getMessage2() perameter thats mean we sure 	
	the first @Bean will proccess is getMessage3() method, but we aren't sure about 	
	getMessage1() & getMessage2() which one will be the first becouse we didn't use 	
	any @Qualifier belongs to them in other @Beans. 

A4:
	the output will be :

	"hey from message3"
	"hey from message1"
	"hey from message2"
	
	OR :

	"hey from message3"
	"hey from message2"
	"hey from message1"

	BECOUSE: the same reason in Q3, and it will not run MainControler() method
 	becouse we didn't use @Bean annotation.

A5:

	the output will be :

	"hey from message3"
	"hey from message1"
	"hey from message2"
	
	OR :

	"hey from message3"
	"hey from message2"
	"hey from message1"

	BECOUSE: the same reason in Q4, there's no @Bean in MainController() method
